# zeek-threathunting
 Custom log capture via Intel::LOG from ZeekJS + Intelligence Framework. If log capture is a compliance risk for you, then this may be a good solution, at least it is triggered by security Incident.

 I use Intel::LOG as a trigger for ThreatHunting when a security event occurs. Once the IoC (Indicator of Compromise) is triggered, I automatically log all HTTP logs via Zeek.
